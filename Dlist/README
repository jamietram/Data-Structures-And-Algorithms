Queue:
Please include the header "queue.h" and define your queue class and its enqueue, 
dequeue member functions in a source file "queue.cc". You need to write your own
test driver "queue_test.cc" to finish the homework problem.

The codes shall be able to get compiled and run via the following commands:
$ make queue_test
$ ./queue_test n t

Please use scientific notation for the average time. The time is in second. 
The standard output is only one line in the format below:
Average Time: 1.2e-06

Example:
$ make queue_test
$ ./queue_test 100000 100000
Average Time: 1.2e-6

Double Linked List:
Please include the header "dlist.h" and define your class and member functions
in a source file "dlist.cc".  You need to write your own test driver "dlist_test.cc"
to finish the homework problem.

The code shall be able to get compiled and run via the following commands:
$ make dlist_test
$ ./dlist_test n

The standard output is only one line in the following format:
Time: time

Example:
$ make dlist_test
$ ./dlist_test 1000
Time: 0.001
